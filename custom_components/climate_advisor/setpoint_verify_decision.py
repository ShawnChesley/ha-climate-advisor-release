"""Pure decision core for the post-fan setpoint verify check (architecture-reset Step 2).

`_activate_fan()` and `_deactivate_fan()` each scheduled a 30-second post-fan
setpoint-verify callback with byte-for-byte IDENTICAL decision logic (found
during the #429 direction-gate consolidation sweep — this isn't a direction
gate, but the exact same copy-paste-drift risk the sweep was looking for).
Both re-assert the last commanded setpoint if the thermostat (e.g. an Ecobee
reverting to its own comfort program) doesn't match it within tolerance.
